# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This Prework Study Guide was created for boot camp students who were going through the Prework. It contains notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. It also contains a working website that can be changed to add more information that was learned throughout the prework. I was motivated by the desire to get a career as a programmer. This is just an introduction to what I will be learning in the boot camp and it provides information on the basics of HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. I learned that I am capable of making a simple website. I learned that I need to have a growth mindset to be able to learn more about coding. Making this website allowed me to learn more about git and programming languages.
